# MySQL/MariaDB Configuration - Disable Binary Logging
# Place this file in /etc/mysql/conf.d/ directory
# Filename: disable-binlog.cnf

[mysqld]
# Disable Binary Logging
# This will override any log-bin settings in the main my.cnf
skip-log-bin

# Optional: Explicitly set log-bin to OFF (alternative method)
# log-bin = OFF

# Related binary log settings that can be disabled for performance
sync_binlog = 0
binlog_cache_size = 0

# Performance optimizations when binary logging is disabled
# Since we're not using replication, we can use more aggressive settings
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0

# Additional performance settings for standalone servers
# (without replication requirements)
innodb_doublewrite = 0

# Disable relay log (used in replication)
skip-slave-start

# Disable GTID if not needed (MySQL 5.6+)
# Note: These settings are for MySQL, MariaDB uses different GTID syntax
gtid_mode = OFF
enforce_gtid_consistency = OFF

# Comments for reference:
# - skip-log-bin: Completely disables binary logging
# - This saves disk space and improves write performance
# - Removes ability to do point-in-time recovery
# - Removes ability to set up master-slave replication
# - Good for development, testing, or standalone production servers
