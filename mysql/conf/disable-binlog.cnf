# MySQL 8.0 Configuration - Disable Binary Logging
# Place this file in /etc/mysql/conf.d/ directory
# Filename: disable-binlog.cnf

# Disable Binary Logging
# This will override any log-bin settings in the main my.cnf
skip-log-bin

# Optional: Explicitly set log-bin to OFF (alternative method)
# log-bin = OFF

# Related binary log settings that can be disabled for performance

# Note: binlog_cache_size minimum value is 4096 in MySQL 8.0, setting to minimum
binlog_cache_size = 4096

# Performance optimizations when binary logging is disabled
# Since we're not using replication, we can use more aggressive settings

# Additional performance settings for standalone servers
# (without replication requirements)
# Note: innodb_doublewrite is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.20+, use innodb_doublewrite_pages instead
innodb_doublewrite_pages = 0

# Disable relay log (used in replication)
# Note: skip-slave-start is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.26+, use skip-replica-start instead

# Disable GTID if not needed (MySQL 5.6+)
# These settings are compatible with MySQL 8.0

# MySQL 8.0 specific optimizations
# Note: innodb_redo_log_archive_dirs is typically not needed for standalone servers
# and is disabled by default in MySQL 8.0

# Note: master_info_repository and relay_log_info_repository are deprecated in MySQL 8.0.23+
# These settings are now handled automatically by MySQL 8.0

# Note: host_cache_size is typically not needed for standalone servers
host_cache_size = 0

# Secure PID file location (eliminates insecure configuration warning)

# SSL/TLS Configuration to eliminate CA certificate warnings
# Use proper SSL configuration instead of self-signed certificates

ssl_cert = 
ssl_key = 
# Disable SSL if not needed (removes CA certificate warnings)

# Comments for reference:
# - skip-log-bin: Completely disables binary logging
# - This saves disk space and improves write performance
# - Removes ability to do point-in-time recovery
# - Removes ability to set up master-slave replication
# - Good for development, testing, or standalone production servers
